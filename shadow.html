    A group of young college students find an old 15th-century coffin, which is equipped with a part clockwork-mechanical/supernatural contraption that enables contact with spirits and even allows one to experience becoming a ghost for a period of time, whilst cheating death's grasp. Their first adventures in this mystery world brought by said 'box of shadows' is just innocent playful fun. But the casket soon brings out their more purely evil side, manifesting their more dangerous impulses and darker desires. Plus, seeing as they are essentially cheating death when they're in that induced ghostly state, 'Death' itself soon comes to claim their decaying souls. A reminder that 'cheating death' is never an option. Eventually showing the group that the thin line between life and death exists for a very specific reason.
